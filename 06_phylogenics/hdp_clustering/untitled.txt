NDP Clustering
The .zip is the files that do the actual dirichlet mutational clustering (modified slightly from Stan and Simon’s code, but essentially the same).
 
the dirichlet_setup.sh is for submitting it to the farm
I’ve included the example input files for running the clustering.
 
which needs the input directory (containing the alt, depth, and mutation context files)
output dir
sample name (prefix at the start of the alt/depth files)
and the number of burnin cycles (I use 15,000)
 
the context_pull.R will generate the mutational contexts in GRCh38 for doing some plotting. it just needs as input a tab-delimitted file with chr, pos, ref, alt
 
you would run the context_pull first, then submit the dirichlet run to the farm.
 
Pigeon Holes
For the pigeonhole plotting here is the gitlab page containing the code:
https://gitlab.internal.sanger.ac.uk/tb14/breast-ndp-tree-building
 
Please let me know if you think of anything that can be improved in the presentation of the page.
 
Interactive plots
And finally here is the gitlab for the interactive mapscape plots I have been making, this is still a bit of a work in progress.:
https://gitlab.internal.sanger.ac.uk/tb14/mapscape-generator
 
Let me know if you run into any issues.
 
Best,
Tim
